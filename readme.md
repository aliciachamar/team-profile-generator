  ## Installation

  Download the contents of this repo to your computer and run npm install. Open your command line, cd into the folder where index.js is located, and type "node index.js" to initiate the application. 


  ## Usage

  The application will ask for information about the team manager, including their name, employee ID, email address, and office number. After the user inputs responses, the application presents a menu to add an engineer, add an intern, or exit the application. When the user chooses to add an engineer, the application will ask for the engineer's name, employee ID, email address, and GitHub username. Once the user inputs responses, the application takes them back to the menu, where they can choose again. When the user chooses to add an intern, the application will ask for the intern's name, employee ID, email address, and school. Once the user returns to the menu, they can choose to exit the application, at which point an HTML file will be generated showing the full team. The email addresses will be mailto links, and the GitHub usernames will take the user to that GitHub profile page.
